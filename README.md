# version-control-cpp
This C++ project is a custom version control system that tracks code changes locally, similar to Git. It allows users to track file versions, commit changes, and restore previous versions. Designed for developers who want to manage code history independently, the project streamlines version tracking with a lightweight, self-made solution.
