# version-control-cpp

## Description
version-control-cpp is a basic version control system written in C++. It tracks changes to files in a specified folder, allowing you to manage code versions locally without the need for a remote repository. The tool is configured using a simple config file, and it stores all version history in a single file. Designed as a command-line tool, SimpleVersionControl offers an easy way to manage code versions and revisions.

## Backstory
This project was developed as part of my coursework for **Object-Oriented Technology (CS 361)**. While learning object-oriented programming in C++, I decided to create my own version control system to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented design patterns, C++ classes, and programming concepts. I started this project midway through the course, as we were diving into object-oriented programming concepts, to enhance my learning through practical application.

## Features
- **Local Version Tracking**: Track changes within a folder and maintain a history of file versions.
- **Configurable Root Folder**: Define the folder to track via a simple configuration file.
- **Version History File**: Store all version data in a custom history file, detailing every change made.
- **Command-Line Interface**: A lightweight CLI for managing file versionsâ€”committing changes, viewing history, and more.
- **No Remote Repository**: Focuses solely on local version control, making it ideal for personal projects or learning purposes.
